display-name: Prometheus Juju Exporter

summary: Charm that exports statistics about number of juju-deployed machines

description: |
  This charm exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus that provides statistics
  about machines deployed by juju controller. It connects to configured juju controller
  and collects information about machines from every model.

  The metrics provide information about machines' states (UP or DOWN) and can be used
  to calculate how many machines are managed by juju controller and in which state they
  are. For more detailed information about exposed metrics and their format see
  prometheus-juju-exporter snap documentation
